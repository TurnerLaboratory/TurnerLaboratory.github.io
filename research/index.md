## Population representation in Drosophila visual projection neurons
Visual scenes are composed of many features that overlap in time and space. Visual systems often parse complex scenes into their component parts, which are then represented by distinct pathways and neural populations. Lobula Columnar neurons (LCs) are a population of visual projection neurons in Drosophila that are involved in many visually guided behaviors, and their visual response properties suggest that they are tuned to diverse visual features. There are at least ~25 distinct classes of LCs, each of which projects from the optic lobes to distinct, non-overlapping optic glomeruli in the central brain. By analogy to the olfactory glomeruli in Drosophila, the glomerular organization of LC projections suggests a hypothesis for how complex scenes and cue combinations are encoded: it is combinations of activated glomeruli that drive visual feature perception, just as combinations of olfactory glomeruli generally drive odor perception. In order to understand how diverse LC neurons represent complex scenes, I have developed imaging and analysis methods to measure neural activity across many LC populations simultaneously. This provides, for the first time, a way to characterize visual projection neuron population responses and relate them to stimulus statistics and animal behavior in real time.

## Structure-function relationships in the Drosophila Brain
The anatomical structure of neural circuits can strongly constrain the function of those circuits. Because of this, neuroscientists have long used nervous system structure to guide investigations of function (and vice-versa). In the age of large-scale connectomics, we need to figure out how we can use precise anatomical information to help us understand neural computation. This presents some conceptual as well as technical challenges. I use the wonderful connectome datasets available in the fly brain to explore how we can leverage this unprecedented access to structural information to better understand how the brain works.

## Visual encoding of behaviorally-relevant stimuli in the vertebrate retina
_Max's PhD dissertation work_

Most of what we know about how the visual system works comes from studies using parameterized, synthetic stimuli (think gratings, white noise, flashing spots and the like). This approach allows us to understand some fundamental features of visual computation and makes it easy to relate features of a stimulus to measured neural responses (i.e. we can easily plot tuning curves for our parameter of interest). However translating what we know about how visual neurons respond to simple, artificial stimuli to naturalistic viewing conditions is not straightforward. In fact most of the models we build based on artificial stimuli arenâ€™t able to generalize to natural scenes very well at all. I used naturalistic stimuli as well as hypothesis-driven artificial stimuli to explore how key features of the spatial receptive field of primate retinal ganglion cells shape neural responses under naturalistic viewing conditions.
