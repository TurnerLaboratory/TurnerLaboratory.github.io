### *Drosophila* whole-brain structural and functional connectivity
*With Kevin Mann*

From: \*__Turner, M.H.__, \*Mann, K., and Clandinin, T.R. [2021]. The connectome predicts resting state functional connectivity across the Drosophila brain. *Current Biology*. 31 (11), 2386-2394. \*Co-first authors. [PDF](/files/Turner_CurrBio_2021.pdf)

This dataset contains whole-brain calcium imaging data of flies in a "resting state" [i.e. not performing some behavior and not being presented with any controlled stimuli], which we can use to measure functional correlations among brain regions. We compared this "functional connectivity" to the structural connectivity present in the *Drosophila* hemibrain connectome (see the excellent Janelia Hemibrain paper [here](https://elifesciences.org/articles/57443) and browse hemibrain connectivity yourself [here](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/flyem/hemibrain)).


### Population imaging of visual responses in optic glomeruli

From: __Turner, M.H.__, Krieger, A., Pang, M.M., and Clandinin, T.R. [2022]. Visual and motor signatures of locomotion dynamically shape a population code for feature detection in Drosophila. *eLife* 11:e82587. [PDF](/files/Turner_eLife_2022.pdf)

This dataset contains pan-glomerulus imaging data of flies presented with various visual stimuli, including panels of synthetic stimuli as well as more naturalistic visual stimuli associated with natural fly walking behavior.
