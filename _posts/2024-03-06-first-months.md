title: First few months of the lab

The lab opened in January of 2024. We have been focusing on building the behavior rig to measure locomotor responses while presenting visual stimuli.

The rig has come together nicely, thanks to wonderful existing tools and resources like [stimpack](https://github.com/ClandininLab/stimpack), [jackfish](https://github.com/jbmelander/jackfish), Michael Reiser's [fantastic open source behavior rig resources](https://reiserlab.github.io/Component-Designs/), Damon Clark's flexible yet unfussy [panoramic visual display design](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.jneumeth.2019.05.005), as well as amazing support from folks at UAlbany, from our great CAS machinist to my colleague Greg Lnenicka who gifted the lab some gently used equipment.

Aside from that we're learning the quirks of the building, which has "character" but "good bones," and getting our money's worth with the label maker.
