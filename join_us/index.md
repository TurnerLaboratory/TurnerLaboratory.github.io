# {% include icon.html icon="fa-regular fa-envelope" %}Join the Turner lab!

We study the neural circuits and computations that allow the brain to make sense of the complex and dynamic visual inputs encountered in the real world. We combine techniques from neuroscience, data science, genetics, and animal behavior to understand natural vision. 
The Turner lab strives to be a welcoming and supportive environment for all of its members. If you want to support this mission, and you're interested in these scientific questions and techniques, please reach out to Max!

### Graduate students
Graduate students in the UAlbany [Biology PhD](https://www.albany.edu/biology/programs/phd-biology) or [Biology Masters](https://www.albany.edu/biology/programs/ms-biology) programs can rotate in or join the lab. If you are in a different graduate program at UAlbany, we can discuss ways to work together.
Please reach out to Max directly via email!

### Postdocs
Postdocs in the lab will have a unique opportunity to develop an independent research project, and will receive support and mentorship in preparation for a future career. 
If you are interested in doing a postdoc in the lab, please reach out to Max with your CV, two professional references, and a copy of the published work you are most proud of (a preprint is OK).
