### Graduate students
Graduate students in the UAlbany [Biology PhD](https://www.albany.edu/biology/programs/phd-biology) or [Biology Masters](https://www.albany.edu/biology/programs/ms-biology) programs can rotate in or join the lab. If you are in a different graduate program at UAlbany, we can discuss ways to work together.
Please reach out to Max directly via email!

### Research assistants
We are looking for interested research assistants to engage in research and help with lab management. Please reach out to Max with your CV and contact information for two professional references.

### Scientific programmer / engineer
We have an opening for a scientific programmer to help develop and maintain critical research software, including new image analysis tools, pipelines for big data management and analysis, three-dimensional scene rendering, and more!
There are also opportunities for working with hardware, including electronics, optics, and visual displays, for interested applicants.
If you have a background in scientific programming, software development, engineering, or data science, you may be a great fit! Please reach out to Max with your CV and contact information for two professional references.

### Postdocs
Postdocs in the lab will have a unique opportunity to develop an independent research project, and will receive support and mentorship in preparation for a future career. 
If you are interested in doing a postdoc in the lab, please reach out to Max with your CV, two professional references, and a copy of the published work you are most proud of (a preprint is OK).
