# The Turner lab at UAlbany

How do visual systems work in the real world? Answering this question means understanding the mechanisms, functions and principles that underlie visual processing and behavior in real animals, doing real behaviors, and seeing real visual scenes.

We use the fruit fly, _Drosophila melanogaster_, as a model to understand natural vision. Fruit flies are very visual creatures, and they perform a wide array of complex visually-guided behaviors. Because of the excellent genetic and connectomic tools available in flies, we can connect features of visual behavior and computation to specific neurons and circuits. We use a variety of techniques, including _in vivo_ two-photon microscopy, behavioral assays, molecular genetics, and computational modeling.

The Turner lab will open its doors in January, 2024!

We are looking for scientists at all levels to join us to understand how the brain processes visual information in naturalistic contexts. Techniques in the lab include _in vivo_ two-photon imaging, analysis of big datasets, animal behavior, and more! We will consider applicants from a wide range of backgrounds, including biology, neuroscience, computer science, engineering, and more. Please reach out to talk about whether you could be a good fit for the lab!
