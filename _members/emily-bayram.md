Emily is a PhD student in the MCDN Biology program at SUNY Albany. She was an undergraduate at SUNY New Paltz and received a degree in biology with a concentration in cellular biology. Her training was mostly in molecular biology; however, she found visual processing in Drosophila interesting and wanted to undertake the challenge of switching her field to neurobiology. Emily's hobbies include baking and cooking, and she loves to cook and bake for her family.
