I'm an undergraduate student majoring in biology with a minor in psychology. I am also an anesthesia techinician at the Albany Med. On campus, I spend my spare time in IBASS as one of the peer tutors. I am also a part of the UAMCAT club wherein I speak and teach about different concepts and study material in relation to the MCAT. In my free time, I enjoy doing photography, playing the guitar, and lifting weights.
