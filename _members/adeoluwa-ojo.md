Adeoluwa (or "Ad" to his friends) is a Master’s student in the Biology program at UAlbany. He graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Biological Neuroscience and a minor in Public Health, where he developed a strong interest in the intersection of cellular mechanisms and systemic health. Now a member of the Turner Lab, he is eager to dive into neurobiological research and contribute to the team’s understanding of visual processing.
Outside of the lab, Adeoluwa stays active through working out, longboarding, and playing competitive quadball. When he isn’t training, he enjoys unwinding with video games, catching up on the latest movies and TV shows, and getting out to meet new people.
