Charmi is a PhD student in the MCDN program at SUNY Albany, with a masterâ€™s in Neuroscience from UT Dallas. Her previous research in C. elegans explored how environmental cues shape sensory neuron identity via molecular and genetic mechanisms. Currently, in the Turner Lab, she studies how Drosophila visual circuits extract meaningful features from dynamic scenes, focusing on the circuit motifs and principles governing feature-selective processing. Outside the lab, she enjoys crime shows, jigsaw puzzles, and debating whether her code or her cooking needs more debugging.
