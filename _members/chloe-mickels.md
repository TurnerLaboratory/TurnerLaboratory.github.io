I am a recent graduate from Skidmore College with a degree in neuroscience. My undergraduate research experience focused on tracking the propagation of neurodegenerative proteins between cerebellar cancer cells. I bring a strong neurobiological background to the lab, and am excited to take on the challenge of working with a new model organism. Outside of research, I enjoy spending time with my dog, stargazing, and adding to my ever-growing collection of plants.
