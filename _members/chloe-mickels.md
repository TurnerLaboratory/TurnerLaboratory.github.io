After graduating from Skidmore College with a B.A. in Neuroscience and a passion for research, Chloe joined the lab with an interest in examining how the role of specific cells and circuits can be linked to broader biological computations, such as vision. Specifically, her project focuses on distinguishing the contributions of a class of feedback neurons to visual processing in Drosophila. Outside of the lab, she enjoys spending time with her dog, stargazing, and adding to her ever-growing collection of plants.
